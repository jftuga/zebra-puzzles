## Step-by-Step Derivation

1. From clue 7, we know the first exhibit is from the 19th century. Only van Gogh's painting fits this.

2. Clue 1 states the Netherlands exhibit (van Gogh's) is immediately left of the fossil. So the fossil must be second.

3. Clue 3 tells us the middle exhibit is from the 15th century. This can only be the Aztec artifact.

4. Clue 6 says the interactive display is immediately right of the exhibit from Mexico (Aztec artifact). So the interactive display must be fourth.

5. By elimination, the sculpture must be last, which is confirmed by clue 2 (sculpture at one end).

6. Clue 4 states the exhibit featuring an animal (fossil) is to the left of the one from France (sculpture). This confirms our current arrangement.

7. Clue 10 confirms van Gogh's work is left of Rodin's, matching our arrangement.

8. Clue 5 confirms the painting (van Gogh's) depicts a place.

9. Clue 8 tells us NASA's exhibit (the interactive display) is about an abstract concept.

10. Clue 9 is satisfied as the Aztec artifact is in the middle, not at either end.

11. Clues 11-12 are really extra hints used to disambiguate various categories.

This derivation uses all clues, including the corrected one, and uniquely determines the position and attributes of each exhibit.
